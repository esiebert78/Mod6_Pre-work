My second attempt at adding text to a file.
Adding second line manually.
Adding line for 3rd commit practice.
Adding line for 4th commit practice.
The fifth line has been added for commit practice.
Couldn't get the 5th time to work, now trying the 6th.
New test, number 7.
Seventh test did not work, trying number 8.
Trying number 9.
Nine worked, going for ten. Make it 2 in a row.
Third time is a charm!
